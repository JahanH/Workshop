# Lab 5 - Programming ASP.NET Core Micro-services

>Starting with this lab we will begin the process of creating a fully functional application which uses several of the Steeltoe components. We will be using a `Fortune Teller` micro-services based application as our staring point.

>The app consists of a `Fortune Teller Service` which provides a REST API to serve up Fortunes and a `Fortune Teller UI` that can be used to display the retrieved Fortunes. In its current state, the app is not fully functional. The `Fortune Teller Service` only serves up a single `Fortune` and the `Fortune Teller UI` doesn't know how to communicate with the `Fortune Teller Service` and as such it always returns the same `Hello from FortuneController UI!` Fortune.

>The goals for this lab:

* Familiarize yourself with the Fortune-Teller lab code.
* Understand and apply the fundamentals of ASP.NET Core programming (e.g. Dependency injection, Configuration, Optioons, etc.)
* Become comfortable with running the lab application locally on your PC and publishing and deploying it to Cloud Foundry.
* Modify the `Fortune Teller Service`:
  * Hook up the `IFortuneRepository` to the `FortunesController`
  * Configure and use an in-memory EF Core database to store Fortunes.
  * Add the `IFortuneRepository` and the `FortuneContext` to the ASP.NET Core service container.
  * Initialize the Fortunes database with some Fortunes.
* Modify the `Fortune Teller UI`:
  * Hook up the `IFortuneService` to the `FortunesController`
  * Add the `IFortuneService` to the ASP.NET Core service container.
  * Use the `Options` framework to configure the `FortuneServiceClient` so that it can communicate with the `Fortune Service`

>When your done with this lab the Fortune Teller UI should be able to retrieve random fortunes from the Fortune Service.

> For some background information on ASP.NET Core programming, have a look at the ASP.NET Core [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core).

## Modify Fortune Teller Service

You will be using ASP.NET Core `Dependency Injection` features for much of the next set of exercises. For some background information on how it works, have a look at this [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection)

Also, in this step you will make use of the `Entity Framework Core` features. For some background information on it, have a look at this [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/#pivot=efcore).

As you work through this section and the next, if you get stuck or are not sure how to proceed, you can always take a look at the finished code for this lab in the `Workshop/Lab05` directory.

### Step 01 - Modify FortunesController to use the IFortuneRepository

1. Modify the `FortunesController` to accept an injected `IFortuneRepository`. You can find the already existing code for `FortuneRepository` in the `Models` folder.
1. Modify each of the `FortunesController` actions to use the injected `IFortuneRepository` to obtain Fortunes.

### Step 02 - Add IFortuneRepository and FortuneContext to Service Container

1. Make the changes needed to the `Startup` class to get the `IFortuneRepository` into the service container so it can be injected into the `FortunesController`.

   Notice that the `FortuneRepository` takes a `FortuneContext` as a argument to its constructor. So you will also need to add a `FortuneContext` to the container. But a `FortuneContext` is built on the `EntityFrameworkCore` library, so you will also need to add that to the container as well.

   At this point in the workshop, we will simply use an in-memory EFCore database. Clearly, if this DbContext was being updated, this in-memory database would be a bad choice as it would prohibit us from scaling this micro-service horizontally. In an upcoming Lab on scaling, we will show you how to use Steeltoe connectors to connect the `DbContext` to a real back-end database.

1. Make the changes needed to the `Startup` class to get Entity Framework Core components added into the service container.

### Step 03 - Initialize FortuneContext with some Fortunes

1. Add some Fortunes to the `FortuneContext`.

   We have already written the code to do that for you. You can make use of the static method `SampleData.InitializeFortunesAsync()`. The question you have to answer is where do you add this? Have a look at the method and notice that the code asks the container for an instance of the `FortuneContext` in order to initialize it with samples. As a result, the container needs to be built before we call this method and also before we start handling any requests. So the best place to add this call is in the `Configure` method in the `Startup` class.

### Step 04 - Run Locally

Run and verify the `Fortune-Teller-Service` returns the Fortunes from the in-memory database. Run the application either in a command window or within VS2017.

### Step 05 - Push to Cloud Foundry

1. Publish, push and verify the application runs on Cloud Foundry.

## Modify Fortune Teller UI

You will be using ASP.NET Core `Dependency Injection` features for much of the next set of exercises. For some background information on how it works, have a look at this [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection)

Also, in this step you will make use of the Configuration and Options features of the ASP.NET Core framework. For some background information on it, have a look at this [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration?tabs=basicconfiguration).

### Step 01 - Modify FortunesController to use the IFortuneService

1. Modify the `FortunesController` to accept an injected `IFortuneService`. You can find the already existing code for `FortuneServiceClient` in the `Services` folder.
1. Modify each of the `FortunesController` actions to use the injected `IFortuneService` to obtain Fortunes.

### Step 02 - Add IFortuneService to Service Container

1. Make the changes needed in the `Startup` class to get the `IFortuneService` into the service container so it can be injected into the `FortunesController`.

### Step 03 - Configure IFortuneService

1. Modify the `appsettings.json` file with the configuration information needed to configure the `FortuneServiceClient`.  The settings you provide will be used by the client so that it can communicate with the Fortune Service.

   Notice the FortuneServiceClient expects to receive an injected `IOptionsSnapshot<FortuneServiceOptions>` which contains the configuration used by the client. Look at the already existing `FortuneServiceOptions` class and the client code to see what properties need to be filled in.

1. Modify the `Startup` class to make use of the `Options` framework to configure the `FortuneServiceOptions` from the values in `appsettings.json` and to add it to the service container so that it will be injected.

### Step 04 - Run both Locally

1. Run the `Fortune-Teller-Service`. Run the application either in a command window or within VS2017.
1. Run the `Fortune-Teller-UI`.  Run the application either in a command window or within VS2017.
1. Verify that the UI can communicate with the Fortune service.

### Step 05 - Push both to Cloud Foundry

1. Publish and push the `Fortune-Teller-Service` to Cloud Foundry.
1. Modify the UI's `appsettings.json` file to configure it to run properly on Cloud Foundry.
1. Publish and push the `Fortune-Teller-UI` to Cloud Foundry.
1. Verify that the UI can communicate with the Fortune service.
